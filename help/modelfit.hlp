niter
Fit image-plane model components to visibilities in the UV plane.
EXAMPLE
-------

 0>modelfit 4
 Partitioning the model into established and variable parts.
 The fixed established model contains 0 components (0 Jy).
 The variable part of the model contains 2 components (0.97 Jy).
 There are 10 variables and 4510 usable visibilities.
 This gives 2 x 4510 - 10 = 9010 degrees of freedom.
 Reduced Chi-squared = Chi-squared / 9010.

ARGUMENTS
---------

niter   -   The number of iterations to try, or zero to just see the
            current fit. 10 and 20 are good numbers to try, before the
            first selfcal. 

CONTEXT
-------
Model fitting directly to the visibilities of interferometric data has
two common uses.

1. It is employed to find good starting models for the initial phase
   self-calibration of phase-unstable data, especially when a point
   source starting model has proved insufficient.

2. It is commonly used to parameterise the general characteristics of
   sources with as few variables as possible.

The difmap modelfit program fits aggregates of various forms of model
components, fitting directly to the real and imaginary parts of the
observed visibilities using the powerful Levenberg-Marquardt
non-linear least squares minimization technique. This makes it
substantially faster and a lesser consumer of memory than the Caltech
VLBI package modelfit program, that fitted to an ad hoc combination of
closure-phase and amplitude.

The disadvantage of the newer algorithm is that it assumes that the
phases are well calibrated. The older algorithm was insensitive to
this through its use of closure phases. As a result, using modelfit in
difmap may require a number of interleaved self-calibration steps to
converge on the model that agrees well with the closure phases.

Note that in version 2.3d the scope of the uvrange command was
extended to include modelfitting. Thus you can now restrict modelfit
to only fit to visibilities that lie within a given range of distances
from the center of the UV plane. This can be useful if you only have
believable flux in the short baselines, or if you want to start by
fitting the brighter larger scale features before complicating the
model with weaker fine structures.

SPECIFYING MODELS FOR MODELFIT
------------------------------
There are three ways to specify model components to modelfit.

1. In model files, components with variable parameters are denoted by
   a 'v' character post-fixing each of the variable parameters.

   Thus in the following model the first component is an elliptical
   gaussian component with all parameters variable except its
   position, while the second component has all parameters variable.

 ! Flux (Jy) Radius (mas)  Theta (deg)  Major (mas)  Axial ratio   Phi (deg) T
   0.140490v     0.00000      0.00000     0.704297v    0.147144v   -48.4654v 1
   0.118984v     1.01917v     137.776v     1.10527v    0.544262v   -57.5779v 1

   The meaning of each of the above parameters (as originally defined
   for the Caltech VLBI package), is as follows:

   Flux     -  The integrated flux in the component (Jy).
   Radius   -  The radial distance of the component center from the
               center of the map (milli-arcsec).
   Theta    -  The position angle of the center of the component (degrees
               North -> East) wrt an imaginary line drawn vertically
               through the map center.

   The following components may be omitted for delta components, except
   when you want to specify spectral indexes, in which case they should
   be specified as zero.

   Major    -  The FWHM major axis of the elliptically stretched
               component (milli-arcsec).
   Ratio    -  The ratio of the minor axis to the major axis (0 -> 1).
   Phi      -  The Position angle of the major axis (degrees North -> East).
   T        -  The type of component. Recognised types are:

                0 - Delta function.
                1 - Gaussian.
                2 - Uniformly bright disk.
                3 - Optically thin sphere.
                4 - Ring.
                5 - Un-supported component type - kept for compatibility.
                6 - Sunyaev-Zel'dovich.

   The following two parameters are used to optionally give components
   spectral indexes.

    Freq    -  The frequency for which the specified Flux value is defined,
               specified in Hz.
    SpecInd -  The spectral index.

   When modelfitting multiple IFs the above two parameters are used to
   compute different fluxes for each IF, such that given an IF frequency
   of f, the corresponding model component flux is:

      Flux * (f/Freq)^SpecInd

   where Flux, Freq and SpecInd are model component parameters
   described above. Note that when multiple spectral line channels are
   selected per IF, the frequency used for each IF is the mean of the
   selected spectral line channel frequencies within that IF. It is
   assumed that the flux doesn't change significantly between
   spectral-line channels within an IF.

   Internally the positions of components are recorded by their X and Y
   axis positions wrt the map center and fitting is wrt these parameters.
   For this reason if either Radius or Theta is made variable, both will
   be taken as variable. It is not possible to fix one or the other
   individually. Similarly, except for the special case of a circular
   component where only Major is marked as variable and the axial ratio
   is exactly 1.0, it is not possible to individually mark Major,Ratio
   and Phi to be fixed. Marking one as variable sets them all as variable.

   More obviously, the model component type T can not be marked to be
   variable.

2. While model components can be specified via a model file in the
   above format, it is usually more convenient to incrementally add
   and remove components interactively via the difmap 'mapplot'
   command. See help mapplot for further details.

3. The final method is really directed towards changing the trial
   parameters of an existing variable model, although new components
   may also be created. This method uses the difmap 'edmodel' command,
   which invokes an editor on an internally generated model scratch
   file, initialized with the existing variable model components,
   appropriately shifted if the 'shift' command has previously been
   used. See help edmodel for further details.
