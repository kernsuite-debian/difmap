Write CLEAN models to a VLBI model file.
EXAMPLE
-------

0>wmodel test.mod
Writing 26 model components to file: test.mod
0>

PARAMETERS
----------
file_name    - (Default=standard output)
               The name to be given to the new model file. If this
               argument is omitted or "" is specified, then the model
               will be displayed on the standard output and also in the
               log file. 

do_continuum - (Default=false)
               If omitted or given as FALSE, the normal established and
               tentative models will be written. If it is given as TRUE,
               then just the continuum model (if any) will be written.

CONTEXT
-------
This command is used to save both the established followed by the
latest clean models in one file. On a later date the model can be
re-read using the 'rmodel' command and used as a starting model.

It can also be used to save the continuum model, if one exists, by
presenting the optional second argument with the value TRUE.

RELATED COMMANDS
