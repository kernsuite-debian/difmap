file_name, do_continuum
Read a new CLEAN model from a VLBI model file.
EXAMPLE
-------

0>rmodel test.mod
A total of 26 model components were read from file test.mod
0>

PARAMETERS
----------
file_name    - The name of an existing model file.

do_continuum - (Default=false)
               If omitted or given as FALSE, the contents of the model
               file will supersede the established and tentative
               models. If it is given as TRUE, then the contents will
               be used to supersede the continuum model.

CONTEXT
-------
There are at least two reasons why one might want to read in an external
a model file. The first is to provide a starting model for
self-calibration - this is best done using the 'startmod' command. The
second is to let one re-start mapping where one left off at an earlier
date.

A third reason that is relevant to spectral-line work, is to read in a
model from a separate observation of the continuum underlying a
spectral-line source. The model produced by the continuum observation
can then be used as a model to be subtracted prior to spectral-line
mapping. See the 'setcont' command for further details.

SIDE EFFECTS
------------
The models read supersede any existing models of the same type. Thus,
if do_continuum is FALSE, the current established and tentative models
will be discarded before reading the new model. If do_continuum is TRUE,
then the current continuum model will be discarded before reading the
new model. So, if you wish to retain these models for later, remember
to use the wmodel command before using rmodel.

RELATED COMMANDS
----------------
startmod  - Self-calibrate an observation with a temporary point-source
            model.
wmodel    - Write clean models to a VLBI model file.
showmodel - Report detailed information about the current models.
save      - Save all data files and the difmap running parameters.
