EXAMPLE 1
---------

0>mapplot beam
Graphics device/type (? to see list, default /NULL): /xw
Move the cursor into the plot window and press 'H' for help
0>

In the above example, no PGPLOT display device had previously been
opened so the second line requests the PGPLOT display device.
Once this has been entered, future uses of mapplot will not require
the device name to be entered. The plot device can be changed with
the "device" command.

0> mapplot map,true

This plots the residual map overlayed with symbols for each model
component.

PARAMETERS
----------
target       -  (Default = map)
                The type of map or beam to display, from:
                 map   -  displays the map,
                 beam  -  displays the dirty beam,
                 cln   -  displays the restored map (after
                                 restoring when necessary).
                 pmap  -  Display a contour/grey-scale residual map
                          of the currently selected polarization,
                          overlaid by polarization vectors formed
                          from the residual Q and U maps.
                 pcln  -  Display a restored contour/grey-scale map
                          of the currently selected polarization,
                          overlaid by polarization vectors formed
                          from restored Q and U maps.

domodel      -  (Default = false)
                If true then any model components that have been
                accumulated will be plotted symbolically.
                Delta components are denoted by '+' symbols, and others
                by their elliptical outline. Positive components
                are drawn in green and negative components in red.
                Variable components are plotted in yellow (orange if
                negative).

usecursor    -  (Default = true)
                If this argument is true, and the plot device has a
                cursor, then the cursor will be displayed for the
                user to use to interact with the image.
                If this argument is false, or the plot device does
                not have a cursor, then as soon as the image has
                been plotted, new commands can be entered at the
                difmap prompt.

RUNNING PARAMETERS
------------------
There are a number of auxiliary parameters that don't appear in the
argument list. Some of these parameters exist as variables, while
others are commands. All are listed below.

False color plotting
====================

Commands:

 mapcolor  -  The 'mapcolor' command allows one to pre-select the
              color table, brightness and contrast under which mapplot
              maps will be plotted.
              See 'help mapcolor' for further details.

 mapfunc   -  The 'mapfunc' command allows one to select the transfer
              function with which the maps in mapplot will be plotted
              and to specify the range of intensities to be displayed.
              See 'help mapfunc' for further details.

contour plotting
================

Variables:

    docont -  If docont==true then future use of 'mapplot' to plot the
              restored map will include a contour representation of
              the clean map. This parameter is ignored when plotting
              the beam and residual maps if false-color has also been
              selected. Docont is initially defined as docont=true.

    levs   -  A 1-D array of contour levels. If this has not been set
              then the default percentage levels of
              -1,1,2,4,8,16,32,64 are used for the map and
              -64,-16,-4,4,16,32,64 for the beam. If valid contour 
              levels are given, they are treated as percentage levels
              if 'cmul' is <= 0, or as absolute levels pre-scaled by
              'cmul' otherwise.
Commands:

 loglevs     -  This command provides a short cut to setting the 'levs'
                variable described above. It sets the contour levels to
                a logarithmic ramp. See 'help loglevs' for further details.

 polvec      -  This command configures the attributes used when displaying
                polarization vectors.

 mark_radec  -  Add an optionally labelled marker to be displayed on
                subsequent maps at a given Right Ascension and Declination.

 mark_xy     -  Add an optionally labelled marker to be displayed on
                subsequent maps at a given X,Y position relative to
                the map center.

Note that only levels that appear in the displayed area are presented
in the list of levels that is written beneath the plot.

Restricting the plotted display range
=====================================
By default, the whole available map or beam area is displayed when
you invoke mapplot. To change this behavior use the xyrange command
(see help xyrange) to select the required sub-image for subsequent
calls to mapplot. Alternatively, the displayed area can be changed
interactively with the cursor and optionally saved for later
calls to mapplot - see below.

USE OF THE CURSOR
-----------------
If your display device has the capability to display a graphics cursor,
then this will be displayed and you will be able to (among other
things) add or remove CLEAN windows. The options are selected by
pressing any of the keyboard or mouse keys given below (the cursor
must be within the display window). In particular, to get a list of
key bindings while running mapplot, hit the 'H' key on your keyboard
and the list will be displayed in your terminal window.

NB. If you have a mouse, the following keys are bound to the mouse
    buttons.
      A - Left mouse button.
      D - Middle mouse button.
      X - Right mouse button.

Mapplot cursor key Bindings
===========================

Key 'A' (left-button)   Set a window vertex. (ie move the cursor to
                        where the start vertex is required and press
                        'A', then move the cursor to the desired
                        position of the opposite corner and again press
                        'A' and the new window will be drawn.
Key 'D' (middle-button) Delete the CLEAN window which has one of its
                        corners closer to the cursor than any other
                        window. This key may also be used to cancel a
                        partially complete window selection.
Key 'C'                 This switches from gray-scale to a pseudo-color
                        plot.
Key 'G'                 Re-plots gray-scale after 'C' has been pressed.
Key 'S'                 Display statistics of the region of the map
                        inside a CLEAN window. This includes the total
                        flux only if the displayed map is a restored
                        map. The window used is the one that has one of
                        its corners closer to the cursor than any
                        other window.
Key 'V'                 Report value and coordinates of the pixel that
                        lies immediately under the cursor. When
                        polarization vectors are being displayed, this
                        also shows the polarization angle and
                        intensity of the pixel.
Key 'Z'                 Select a sub-image to be displayed by pressing
                        the 'A' key at two opposite corners of the
                        required area.
                        To cancel sub-image selection, press 'D' at any
                        point during the selection. To zoom out back to
                        the full display area, press 'Z' a second time.
Key 'K'                 Pressing this key will tell mapplot to remember
                        the current sub-image boundaries on the next
                        call to mapplot.
Key 'f' (lower case)    Pressing this key over a particular position in
                        the plot changes the brightness and contrast of
                        the displayed colormap. The X-axis position
                        of the cursor controls the brightness, increasing
                        from left to right. The Y-axis position controls
                        the contrast, with 0 contrast in the middle of the
                        plot, positive contrasts below this and negative
                        contrasts above.
Key 'F'                 This resets the colormap brightness and contrast
                        to the defaults: brightness=1.0, contrast=0.5.
Key 'c' (lower case)    This changes the colormap from grey-scale to the
                        default color colormap.
Key 'C'                 This allows you to select a colormap by name.
                        At the prompt, type in the name of the required
                        colormap, or enter nothing to leave things as
                        they are.
Key 'T'                 Re-display the plot with a specified transfer
                        function (log,linear,sqrt). At the prompt,
                        enter the name of the transfer function required.
Key 'L'                 Re-display the current plot.
Key 'm' (lower case)    This toggles whether to overlay a symbolic
                        representation of the model on the map.
Key 'M' (upper case)    This toggles whether to overlay a symbolic
                        representation of just the variable components
                        of the model on the map.
Key 'N'                 Initiate creation of a new model component -
                        see later.
Key 'R'                 Remove the component that has the closest center
                        to the cursor. This deletes the component from
                        the established or tentative model of the
                        observation. Note that if you plan to delete
                        many components a faster way is to use the
                        difmap 'winmod' command.
Key 'U'                 Remove the marker nearest the cursor.
Key 'H'                 Display list of key bindings.

Key 'X' (right-button)  Exit from 'mapplot'.

DISPLAYING RESTORED MAPS
------------------------
There are two ways of having the map restored and plotted.
You can either call the 'restore' command explicitly then type
'mapplot cln', or simply type 'mapplot cln'. For example:

0>restore 1.2,2.5,-32
0>mapplot cln

or

0> mapplot cln

In the first case a non-default restoring beam size was required
so restore was invoked explicitly. In the second case restore is
called by mapplot, with no arguments.

Note that if you typed:

0>restore 1.2,2.5,-32
0>mapplot

then since mapplot defaults to plotting the residual map when given
no arguments, it will re-invert the data and display the residual
map - take care!

DISPLAYING POLARIZATION VECTORS
-------------------------------

If you have a observation that either contains the Q and U stokes
parameters, or the LR and RL polarizations, mapplot is capable of
displaying linear polarization as short vectors overlaid on the
grey-scale/contour image of the current map. The length of the vectors
reflects the polarized intensity in the underlying pixel, and the
angle of the vector indicates the associated polarization angle. A
detailed example of how to plot polarization maps can be read in the
polarization help page. Basically you need to switch to multi-model
mode, so that models associated with the maps that you make of Q and U
are kept separately by difmap, and used by the mapplot command to
remake these maps behind the scenes.  One makes individual maps of Q,
U and the polarization that you want to display under the polarization
vectors, configure the properties of the polarization vectors using
the 'polvec' command, and type:

 mapplot pcln

This displays the polarization vectors overlaid over the map of the
currently selected polarization.

Note that a polarization angle of zero points towards the top of the
map, and increases as the vector rotates from North through East (ie.
anticlockwise in mapplot). You can examine the polarization angle and
intensity of any given pixel in the displayed map by pressing the 'v'
key while the cursor is over the pixel of interest.

MARKING AND LABELLING FEATURES IN MAPS
--------------------------------------

Difmap maintains a list of map markers that can be displayed on
maps. Markers are added to this list with the 'mark_radec' and
'mark_xy' commands. The former command is useful for labeling known
sources by their Right Ascension and Declination, whereas the latter,
which allows one to mark a given X,Y position in a map, is useful for
labeling newly discovered features, first seen in difmap maps.

Individual markers can be removed from the list, either interactively
in mapplot, with the 'u' key, or non-interactively using the
'delmarker' command. The whole list of markers can also be deleted
using the 'clear_markers' command.

Note that although mapplot doesn't provide an interactive way to add
markers (there are too many parameter for this to be automated with a
single mouse-button click), when defining a new X,Y marker from the
keyboard, the position of the feature to be labelled can first be
found interactively in mapplot using the 'v' key.

SIDE EFFECTS
------------
Note that changes to the colormap selection, brightness and
contrast within mapplot remain in place after you exit mapplot.
It is thus possible to set these parameters interactively in mapplot
for subsequent mapplot plots. In particular, this is invaluable for
making hard copies in color after setting the desired colors on
an interactive device.

When displaying a residual map or dirty beam the UV data will be
re-inverted if recent changes to the grid weighting or modifications
to the data itself, eg. editing, make the current residual map out of
date.

When plotting the restored map (using the cln option) the map will
be restored if an up-to-date restored map has not already been
created with the 'restore' command. In this case 'restore' will be
called with no arguments.

If new components are interactively added, or deleted then the map
will be marked as out of date and will be re-inverted the next time
that it is required.

MODEL COMPONENT CREATION AND DELETION
-------------------------------------
Maplot can be used to interactively add and/or remove variable model
components pertinent to subsequent model fitting. Other forms of
variable model component editing should be performed with the difmap
'edmod' command. The changes to the map itself are NOT displayed as
model components are added and removed. This would take too long. Only
changes to the symbolic outlines of components are displayed.

The syntax used to create a component is as follows:

Press 'N' to initiate description of a new component.

Press 'A' (left-mouse-button) between 0 and 3 times, to describe
          the position and dimensions of the new component.

Press 'N' to install the component, or press 'D' (middle-mouse-button)
          to cancel the component.

Each press of the 'A' key over a point in the map describes one more
variable feature of the component, starting from a delta component at
the center of the map. The optional steps (0 selections to 3
selections) are as follows:

0. If 'N' is pressed without having described any parameters then a
   delta component will be placed at the center of the map.

1. The first click of the 'A' key over a selected point in the map
   defines the position of the center of the new component. A dot
   is plotted to indicate its position.

   Pressing 'N' at this point installs a delta-component at this
   position.

2. A second click of the 'A' key over another selected position in the
   map defines the axis of a circular gaussian, as the line joining
   the selected component center to the newly selected position. This
   line is drawn so that one can judge its veracity.

   Pressing 'N' at this point installs a circular gaussian with the
   axial ratio and axial position angle as fixed parameters.

3. A third click of the 'A' key describes the second axis of an
   elliptical gaussian component via its distance from the selected
   component center. The position angle of the first axis selected (in
   step 2 above) defines the major axis position angle. A line is
   drawn at right angles to the first axis so that one can check its
   veracity.

   Pressing 'N' at this point installs an elliptical gaussian with all
   parameters variable. Pressing 'D' cancels the component.

Once the component is installed, its symbol representation is displayed.

If the component turns out to be poorly described, you can then delete
it with the 'R' (remove component) key.

Note that the flux given to the component is simply the flux of the pixel
under its center. This is not a very good choice, but it is hard to
see what would be a good choice, especially given that the map is not
re-inverted and re-displayed in maplot each time a new component is
added or removed. If you have a better idea of what the component flux
should be, use the difmap 'edmod' command to change it. Alternatively
let the difmap 'modelfit' command find it for you.

EXTENDED EXAMPLE
----------------
To plot a restored map with non-default percentage contours and a reduced
grey-scale saturation flux:

mapfunc linear, -1, 0.5
levs=-0.1,0.1,0.25,0.5,1,2,4,8,16,32,64
cmul=0
mapplot cln

In the above case, the levs= assignment could be avoided by using
the loglevs command.

loglevs 0.1

See help loglevs for more details.
